# Mxnet-Performance-Research

This research is a side project of [Argus group](https://compas.cs.stonybrook.edu/projects/argus/).
Apache-Mxnet features its highly scalable framework and thereby demonstrates the linear speedup over the number of GPUs in [its example of image classification](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/image-classification)
Our purpose is to clarify the reliability of scalable framework and meanwhile measure the computing performance in both HPC and cloud environments.

## Getting Started
Apache MXNet (incubating) is a deep learning framework compatible with both symbolic-style and imperative-style programming.
